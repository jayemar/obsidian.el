;;; Commentary:
;; Obsidian.el lets you interact with more convenience with markdown files
;; that are contained in an Obsidian Notes vault.  It adds autocompletion for
;; tags and links, jumping between notes, capturing new notes into inbox etc.
;;
;; This allows you to use Emacs for editing your notes, leaving the Obsidian
;; app for syncing and doing more specialized stuff, like viewing notes graphs.

Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

- `\\(?:\\`\\|[[:space:]]\\)`: Matches the beginning of the document (`\\``) or any
whitespace character (`[[:space:]]`). This ensures that the tag either starts at the
beginning of the document or is preceded by a whitespace character.

- `\\(#`: Matches the starting hashtag of the tag and begins a capturing group for the tag itself.

- `\\(?:[A-Za-z_/][-A-Za-z0-9_/]*[A-Za-z_/][-A-Za-z0-9_/]*\\)`: This ensures that
the tag has at least one non-numerical character (A-Z) and allows the use of letters,
numbers, underscores, hyphens, and forward slashes. The first and last
segments (`[A-Za-z_/]`) ensure that the tag contains at least one non-numeric
character outside the start and end. Numbers will not be allowed as the only characters of a tag.
